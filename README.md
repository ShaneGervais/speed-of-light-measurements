# speed-of-light-measurements
Curve fitting analysis for measurement of the speed of light from laser pulses traveling to different mirror path lengths and is also used for measurements of speed of a signal through BNC cables. This sets as a reference to measuring delay measurements and shows how different fits adjust measurement results.
